## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?  The vehicle length and the ground_clearance. 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?  The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. This is because the linear regression shows that some of the independent variables had a significant effect on the dependent variable.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?  Yes.  The R squared value is 71.49% which implies that roughly 71% of the time the predictions will be correct using the linear model

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The Suspension_Coil csv was imported into R and then converted into a data frame.  Two subset tables were then created: Total Summary and Lot Summary.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
